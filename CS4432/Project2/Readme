Section I:
- Place files in Project2Dataset folder
- Run commands exactly in the same format as stated in HW2's pdf

Section II:
- All commands work, however...
- I was unable to optimize Range-Based Query Lookup with the use of array-based index; the Full Table Scan is less costly when in reality the array-based indexing should be cheaper
- i.e. for the commands "CREATE INDEX ON Project2Dataset (RandomV)" followed with "SELECT * FROM Project2Dataset WHERE RandomV > 1234 AND RandomV < 1300"
- Full Table Scan --> Data files read: 99
- Array-Indexing --> Data files read: 152

Section III:
- Created ArrayIndex, HashIndex, and Stopwatch classes in addition to a Main class
- Static boolean variables hashCreated and arrayCreated in Main class, used to determine if query lookup should do a Full Table Scan
- Records are printed in full (including the three ... at the end)
- Program assumes all inputted values in commands will be valid and in bounds (v is between 1 and 5000)
- Does not check for user input error
